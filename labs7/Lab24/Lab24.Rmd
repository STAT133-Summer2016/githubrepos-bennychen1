## Monty Hall Generalization

In the classic Monty Hall problem, there are three doors. Behind one of those doors is a car, and behind each of the other two doors is a goat. The contestant picks a door and Monty opens one of the remaining doors, one he knows doesn't hide the car. After Monty has shown a goat behind the door that he opens, the contestant is given the option to switch doors.

Write a function called "simMH" that generalizes the Monty Hall problem. Your function should take the following arguments:

`n`: the total number of doors;

`k`: the number of doors Monty opens;

`switch`: a logical value stating whether or not contestant decides to switch doors

Your function should return:

`win`: a logical value stating whether or not the contestant has selected the door that hides the car

Recall: For a vector `x` of length 1, `sample()` considers `x` to be the vector `1:x`. It might be helpful to define a new function that will always return `x` if `length(x) == 1` but works like the regular `sample()` function for `x` of length greater than 1.


```{r}
new_sample <- function(n, k) {
  if(length(n) == 1) {
    return(n)
  } else {
    sample(n, k)
  }
}

simMH <- function(n, k, switch) {
  doors <- 1:n
  car <- sample(1:n, 1)
  select <- sample(1:n, 1)
  to_open <- doors[-c(car, select)]
  monty_open <- new_sample(to_open, k)
  win <- T
  lose <- F
  if(switch == T) {
    switch_choice <- new_sample(n = doors[-c(select, monty_open)], k = 1)
      if(switch_choice == car) {
        win <- T
      } else {
        win <- F
      }
  } else {
    if(select == car) {
      win <- T
    } else {
      win <- F
    }
  }
}
```

Check:
```{r, eval = T}
set.seed(12345)
x <- replicate(10000, simMH(3, 1, switch = TRUE))
sum(x)/length(x) #0.6681, exact answer: 2/3

x <- replicate(10000, simMH(100, 98, switch = TRUE))
sum(x)/length(x) #0.9905, exact answer: 0.99

x <- replicate(10000, simMH(4, 1, switch = TRUE))
sum(x)/length(x) #0.3844, exact answer: 3/8
```



## Monte Carlo Estimation of $\pi$ 

Consider a circle embedded inside of the unit square. Let X and Y be independent random variables representing the x and y coordinates of a point, and suppose X and Y are uniformly distributed between [-1, 1]. 

Note: The probability $(X,Y)$ lies inside the circle is equal to $$\frac{\pi r^2}{4r^2}$$ Therefore, to find $\pi$, we need only take $4*P(X^2 + Y^2 \le r^2)$. In this case, $r = 1$

Write a function called "estimatePi" that takes in the the following arguments:

`num.points`: an integer value stating the number of points to select from the unit square

The function should return the following:

`pi_hat`: estimation of $\pi$

```{r}
estimatePi <- function(num.points) {
  x <- runif(num.points)
  y <- runif(num.points)
  in_circle <- ifelse(x ^ 2 + y ^2 <=1, T, F)
  pi_hat <- 4 * sum(in_circle) / num.points
  return(pi_hat)
}
```


Check:
```{r, eval = T}
set.seed(456123)
estimatePi(100000) #3.1408
```
